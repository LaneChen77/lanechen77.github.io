# About Me
I am a Master student in Applied Statistics at Fudan University and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.Wang Jian.Before that, I did my undergrad at Fudan University where I received a B.S. in Data Science.
I'm intersted in deep learning theory, automonous driving.

[**BEVVLM Repository**](https://github.com/LaneChen77/BEVVLM)

A cutting-edge research project that combines Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception with Vision Language Models for enhanced autonomous driving capabilities. This project represents a significant advancement in multi-modal understanding for autonomous vehicles.

**Key Features:**
- Integration of BEV spatial representation with natural language understanding
- Multi-modal fusion architecture for comprehensive scene interpretation
- Real-time inference capabilities for autonomous driving applications
- Comprehensive evaluation on autonomous driving benchmarks
