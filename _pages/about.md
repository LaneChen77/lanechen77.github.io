<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Lane Chen, a PhD student specializing in Computer Vision and Autonomous Driving. My research focuses on advancing the understanding of complex driving scenes through cutting-edge computer vision techniques, with particular emphasis on Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception and Vision Language Models (VLMs).

My work bridges the gap between visual perception and semantic understanding in autonomous driving systems, developing novel approaches that enable vehicles to better interpret and navigate through complex real-world environments. I am passionate about creating robust, efficient, and interpretable AI systems that can understand the world as comprehensively as humans do.

I am currently pursuing my PhD degree and actively contributing to the computer vision and autonomous driving research community through publications and open-source projects.
